# THEE IGLOO MESSAGING APP

Hello, I'm Brandon Brungardt, the developer behind Thee Igloo Messaging App. This is my first solo full-stack mobile application, built using React Native CLI. The Igloo is a secure messaging app that provides real-time communication among friends and within group chats.

The application is built with a robust tech stack including React Native, Node.js, MongoDB, and Socket.IO. User security is ensured through JWT access and refresh tokens, and sensitive user information is securely stored using Async Storage and React Native Keychain.

One of the key challenges I faced during the development was implementing remote notifications. I successfully overcame this by integrating the Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) with React Native Push Notification IOS, providing a seamless notification experience for users.

This project was a significant learning experience for me, deepening my knowledge of React Native, mobile development, and MongoDB. It was a great opportunity to apply and enhance my skills in a practical, real-world scenario.

I originally started the project here:[TheIgloo2.0](https://github.com/bbrungardt02/TheIgloo2.0)
